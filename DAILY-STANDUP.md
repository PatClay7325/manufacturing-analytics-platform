## Today: June 25, 2025

### Yesterday's Progress
- ✅ **Completed:** Fixed chat functionality and performance issues
- ✅ **Completed:** Claude Code update issue resolved (1.0.7 → 1.0.34)
- ✅ **Completed:** Created comprehensive POC realignment plan
- ✅ **Completed:** All critical system issues resolved

### Today's Focus
- 🎯 **Primary:** Start SAP Business One payload simulator
- 🎯 **Secondary:** Create integration test harness framework
- 🎯 **Tertiary:** Begin OEE drill-down UI components

### Sprint Goals (Week 1)
- [ ] Complete OEE trend charts with drill-down
- [ ] Add Pareto chart for downtime analysis  
- [ ] Implement 3-click navigation paths
- [ ] Add AI query boundaries
- [x] Create POC tracking system

### Current Blockers
- ❌ **Integration work:** Need to start ERP connectors (critical path)
- ⚠️ **Demo data:** No realistic dataset for 30-day scenarios
- ⚠️ **UI flow:** Missing drill-down navigation patterns

### Progress Updates
- **Overall POC:** 35% (was 30% yesterday)
- **Week 1 Sprint:** 20% complete (tracking system done)
- **Critical Path:** AT RISK - need integration work ASAP

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. Build SAP B1 JSON payload structure
2. Create CLI test harness skeleton
3. Design drill-down navigation flow
