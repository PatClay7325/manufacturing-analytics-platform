# Manufacturing Analytics Platform - Enhanced POC Plan v2.0

**Plan Updated**: January 25, 2025  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks intensive development (Jan 25 â€“ Mar 7, 2025)  
**Status**: ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL RECOVERY MODE** - Emergency plan activation required  

## Executive Overview

This enhanced plan addresses critical gaps identified in the current POC implementation. The original plan was too optimistic and missed fundamental system integration requirements. This revision ensures POC success through detailed acceptance criteria, risk mitigation, and realistic timelines.

**Reality Check**: Current system is non-operational. This plan treats January 25 as Day 1 of actual development.
