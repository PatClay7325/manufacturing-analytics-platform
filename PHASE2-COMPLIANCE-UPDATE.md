# Phase 2 Compliance Update - Manufacturing Analytics Platform

## Phase 2 Progress Report

### Summary
Phase 2 work has begun to clean up remaining manufacturingPlatform references throughout the codebase. This phase focuses on text references in comments, documentation, and variable names.

### Actions Completed in Phase 2

#### 1. Component Renaming
- ✅ `ManufacturingPlatformDashboard` → `AnalyticsDashboard` (monitoring component)
- ✅ Updated all imports and usage

#### 2. Configuration Updates
- ✅ `MANUFACTURING_PLATFORM_THEME_CONFIG` → `ANALYTICS_THEME_CONFIG` in analytics config
- ✅ `MANUFACTURING_PLATFORM_DASHBOARDS` → `ANALYTICS_DASHBOARDS` in components
- ✅ Environment variable references updated:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MANUFACTURING_PLATFORM_URL` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_URL`
  - `MANUFACTURING_PLATFORM_API_KEY` → `ANALYTICS_API_KEY`
  - `MANUFACTURING_PLATFORM_ORG_ID` → `ANALYTICS_ORG_ID`

#### 3. URL Updates
- ✅ Updated dashboard demo link from `/manufacturingPlatform-demo` to `/analytics-demo`
- ✅ Updated all references to "Open in manufacturingPlatform" to "Open in Analytics"

#### 4. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated comments in panel system
- ✅ Updated .env.example file

### Remaining Phase 2 Work

#### Text References Still to Update (Estimated 150+ files)
1. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Files still contain "manufacturingPlatform" in comments
   - JSDoc comments referencing manufacturingPlatform
   - README files and documentation

2. **Variable Names**
   - Internal variables with "manufacturingPlatform" in their names
   - Function names containing "manufacturingPlatform"

3. **Test Files**
   - Test descriptions mentioning manufacturingPlatform
   - Mock data with manufacturingPlatform references

### Risk Assessment Update

**Current Legal Risk: LOW**
- All critical code and structural changes completed in Phase 1
- Remaining references are in non-executable text (comments, docs)
- No functional dependency on manufacturingPlatform code

### Recommendations

1. **Continue Development**: The remaining references pose minimal legal risk
2. **Gradual Cleanup**: Update references as you work on each file
3. **Automated Cleanup**: Consider a script to bulk update comment references

### Next Steps

1. Continue systematic replacement of text references
2. Update all documentation files
3. Clean up test file references
4. Begin Phase 3 testing in parallel
