# ✅ Database Connection Fixed

## Issue Resolved
The application was failing to connect to PostgreSQL because of a password mismatch in the configuration files.

## Root Cause
- Docker container was configured with password: `postgres`
- Application .env files had password: `password`
- The database schema wasn't created yet

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Database URLs
```bash
# Updated in both .env and .env.local:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/manufacturing?schema=public"
```

### 2. Created Database Schema
```bash
npx prisma db push
```
This created all necessary tables including:
- User
- Team
- Organization
- Equipment
- Metric
- Alert
- AuditLog
- Dashboard
- And many more...

### 3. Seeded Demo Data
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```
This created:
- Demo users (admin, operator, analyst) with password "demo123"
- Sample equipment and production data
- Metrics and dashboards
- Alert configurations

## Current Status
✅ Database connection working
✅ All tables created
✅ Demo users available
✅ Manufacturing data seeded
✅ Login system functional

## Demo Credentials
- admin@example.com / demo123
- operator@example.com / demo123
- analyst@example.com / demo123

The application is now fully functional with the quick login buttons!
