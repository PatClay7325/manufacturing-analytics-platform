 ⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected: 
 ⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'instrumentationHook', 'serverComponentsExternalPackages' at "experimental"
 ⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'swcMinify'
 ⚠ See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config
 ⚠ The "experimental.esmExternals" option has been modified. experimental.esmExternals is not recommended to be modified as it may disrupt module resolution. It should be removed from your next.config.js.
 ⚠ `experimental.instrumentationHook` is no longer needed, because `instrumentation.js` is available by default. You can remove it from next.config.js.
 ⚠ `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` has been moved to `serverExternalPackages`. Please update your next.config.js file accordingly.
