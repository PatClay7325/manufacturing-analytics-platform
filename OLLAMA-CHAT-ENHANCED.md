# Ollama Chat Enhanced with Self-Critique

## Overview

The Ollama Chat interface at http://localhost:3000/ollama-chat has been enhanced with conversational AI capabilities, ontology understanding, and self-critique features.

## Key Features

### 1. **Enhanced Mode Toggle**
- Toggle between Standard and Enhanced modes
- Enhanced mode is enabled by default
- Visual indicator shows active mode

### 2. **Conversational AI with Self-Critique**
When in Enhanced Mode:
- **Manufacturing Ontology**: Understands equipment aliases, manufacturing terms
- **Self-Critique Loop**: Automatically improves responses to achieve 9.5+/10 quality
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and understands references
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Provides relevant next questions
- **Quality Indicators**: Shows critique score for each response

### 3. **Visual Enhancements**
- Gradient backgrounds for enhanced mode
- Quality score indicators (‚ú® for 9+/10, üëç for 7+/10, ‚ö†Ô∏è for lower)
- Confidence percentages
- Intent detection display
- Processing time metrics

## Usage

### Standard Mode
Uses the regular chat API without self-critique:
- Faster responses
- Basic query processing
- No quality scoring

### Enhanced Mode (Default)
Uses the conversational API with self-critique:
- Higher quality responses
- Automatic improvement cycles
- Context-aware conversations
- Manufacturing ontology understanding

## API Endpoints

- **Standard**: `/api/chat`
- **Enhanced**: `/api/chat/conversational`

## Example Queries

Enhanced mode excels at:
1. **Complex Analysis**: "What are the top 5 defect types this week?"
2. **Root Cause**: "Why is Line 2 having so many issues?"
3. **Comparisons**: "Compare performance between shifts"
4. **Follow-ups**: "Tell me more about that" (understands context)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/app/ollama-chat/page.tsx` - Added mode toggle and conditional rendering
2. `/src/components/ai/ConversationalChatInterface.tsx` - New enhanced chat component
3. `/src/app/api/chat/conversational/route.ts` - API endpoint for enhanced chat

### Key Components:
- **ConversationalManufacturingAgent**: Handles chat with context
- **SelfCritiqueService**: Evaluates and improves responses
- **ManufacturingOntology**: Domain knowledge base

## Response Quality Metrics

Each response in Enhanced Mode shows:
- **Quality Score**: 0-10 rating from self-critique
- **Confidence**: How certain the AI is about the response
- **Intent**: What type of query was detected
- **Processing Time**: Total time including critique cycles

## Benefits

1. **Better Accuracy**: Self-critique catches and fixes incomplete answers
2. **Context Understanding**: Knows what "it" or "that equipment" refers to
3. **Domain Expertise**: Understands manufacturing terminology via ontology
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Each response goes through improvement cycles

## Limitations

- Enhanced mode may be slightly slower (200-500ms overhead)
- Requires more computational resources
- Self-critique is limited to 3 iterations max

## Future Enhancements

1. Add streaming support for real-time responses
2. Implement learning from user feedback
3. Cache critique results for similar queries
4. Add voice input/output support
