- [ ] No runtime import errors

### 2. Component Functionality Tests
- [ ] Analytics Layout renders correctly
- [ ] Analytics Navigation works properly
- [ ] Analytics Dashboard displays properly
- [ ] Panel system loads and displays data
- [ ] Variable system functions correctly

### 3. Route and API Tests
- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Analytics proxy endpoints work
- [ ] Dashboard API endpoints function

### 4. Integration Tests
- [ ] Dashboard creation and editing
- [ ] Panel configuration
- [ ] Time range selection
- [ ] Data source connections
- [ ] Alert system functionality

### 5. UI/UX Tests

- [ ] No broken links to old manufacturingPlatform routes
- [ ] Proper branding throughout
- [ ] Navigation works as expected

### 6. Configuration Tests

3. Test variable interpolation
4. Test time range controls

### Phase 3.3: Data Flow (Day 3)
1. Test data fetching
2. Test real-time updates
3. Test alert triggering
4. Test data persistence

### Phase 3.4: Edge Cases (Day 4)
1. Test error handling
2. Test loading states
3. Test empty states
4. Test permission boundaries

## Automated Test Suite

Run existing tests:
```bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```
