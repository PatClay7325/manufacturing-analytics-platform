2. **TimescaleDB Hypertables** (Jan 23): Implemented for optimal time-series performance
3. **Composite Primary Keys** (Jan 23): Required for TimescaleDB partitioning
4. **Single Chat Interface** (Jan 24): Consolidated all chat interfaces to /ollama-chat

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **SAP Integration Complexity**: Need early access to test environment
2. **Performance at Scale**: Plan load testing early in Week 10
3. **User Adoption**: Focus on intuitive UI and comprehensive training

### Dependencies
1. **Customer to provide**: SAP credentials, Ignition access, production data samples
2. **Team needs**: 5 developer licenses, staging environment, GPU for AI training
3. **External services**: Docker Hub access, npm registry access
