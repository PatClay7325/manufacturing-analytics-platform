# Manufacturing Analytics Platform - Integration Framework

The integration framework provides a comprehensive system for connecting the Manufacturing Analytics Platform to external manufacturing systems, processing data, and delivering it to the platform's components.

## Core Components

### 1. IntegrationManager

The `IntegrationManager` is the central component responsible for managing the lifecycle of integration adapters and pipelines. It provides:

- **Lifecycle management**: Initialize, start, stop, and shutdown operations
- **Adapter registration and discovery**: Register, retrieve, and categorize adapters
- **Monitoring and health checks**: Track adapter status, performance, and errors
- **Error handling and recovery**: Automatic reconnection, circuit breaker pattern
- **Event handling**: Process adapter events and publish status changes

### 2. IntegrationRegistry

The `IntegrationRegistry` manages the registration and categorization of integration adapters:

- **Adapter registration**: Register and deregister adapters
- **Categorization**: Group adapters by protocol, system type, vendor, etc.
- **Metadata management**: Track adapter versions, capabilities, and tags
- **Search and discovery**: Find adapters matching specific criteria

### 3. IntegrationConfig

The `IntegrationConfig` module handles configuration management:

- **Configuration validation**: Validate against schemas for each integration type
- **Secure credential management**: Encrypt sensitive fields like passwords and tokens
- **Environment-specific configuration**: Support different configurations for dev, test, and production
- **Schema management**: Register and manage configuration schemas

### 4. IntegrationPipeline

The `IntegrationPipeline` provides a flexible data processing system:

- **Pipeline stages**: Source, transformer, validator, filter, sink, and custom stages
- **Error handling and retry logic**: Configure retry behavior for each stage
- **Monitoring and metrics**: Track processing time, success rates, and errors
- **Conditional processing**: Apply filters and conditions to data flows

## Usage Example

The `manufacturing-integration-example.ts` file demonstrates how to use the integration framework to:

1. Connect to an OPC UA server in a manufacturing facility
2. Transform machine data into a standardized format
3. Validate data against industry standards
4. Filter data based on threshold conditions
5. Generate alerts for anomalous conditions
6. Store data in a time-series database

## Key Features

- **Flexible adapter system**: Support for different protocols (MQTT, OPC UA, REST, etc.)
- **Data transformation**: Convert between external and internal data formats
- **Data validation**: Ensure data meets schema and industry standards
- **Health monitoring**: Track adapter health and performance
- **Automatic recovery**: Handle connection failures and errors gracefully
- **Environment configuration**: Deploy to different environments with appropriate settings
- **Security**: Protect sensitive credentials and information

## Getting Started

To use the integration framework, follow these steps:

1. Create configuration for your integration
2. Validate and secure the configuration
3. Register adapters for your external systems
4. Set up transformers and validators as needed
5. Create a pipeline to process data
6. Start the integration manager
7. Monitor performance and health

For detailed examples, see the `examples` directory.

## Architecture

The integration framework follows a modular architecture:

```
IntegrationManager
    ├── IntegrationRegistry
    │   └── AdapterMetadata
    ├── IntegrationAdapter
    │   ├── MqttAdapter
    │   ├── OpcUaAdapter
    │   └── RestApiAdapter
    ├── IntegrationConfig
    │   └── EnvironmentConfig
    └── IntegrationPipeline
        ├── DataTransformer
        ├── DataValidator
        └── PipelineStage
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate configurations** before using them
2. **Secure credentials** using the configuration manager
3. **Monitor adapter health** to detect issues early
4. **Use pipeline stages** to create flexible data flows
5. **Implement proper error handling** at each stage
6. **Create environment-specific configurations** for different deployments

## Extending the Framework

The framework can be extended by:

1. Creating new adapter implementations for additional protocols
2. Developing custom transformers for specific data formats
3. Implementing validators for industry standards
4. Adding custom pipeline stages for specialized processing

## Troubleshooting

- Use the health check methods to diagnose issues
- Check adapter logs for connection problems
- Verify configuration validity before deployment
- Monitor pipeline statistics to identify bottlenecks
