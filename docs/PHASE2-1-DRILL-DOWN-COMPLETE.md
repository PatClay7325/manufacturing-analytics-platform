## Key Technical Features

### Drill-Down Architecture
```typescript
// State management for detailed views
const [detailedView, setDetailedView] = useState<{
  metric: string;
  equipmentId?: string;
  title?: string;
} | null>(null);

// KPI click handler
const handleKPIClick = (metric: string, title: string) => {
  setDetailedView({
    metric,
    equipmentId: selectedEquipment[0],
    title: `${title} Details`
  });
};

// Chart click handler
const handleChartClick = (metric: string, title: string) => {
  setDetailedView({
    metric,
    title: `${title} Analysis`
  });
};
```

### Manufacturing Time Logic
```typescript
// Intelligent shift detection
const getCurrentShift = () => {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  if (hour >= 6 && hour < 14) return 'day';      // 6AM-2PM
  if (hour >= 14 && hour < 22) return 'evening'; // 2PM-10PM
  return 'night';                                 // 10PM-6AM
};
```

### Baseline Calculation System
```typescript
// Historical average calculation
const getHistoricalAverage = async (period: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/history', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      metrics: [metric],
      startTime: calculateStartTime(period),
      endTime: timeRange.start.toISOString(),
      interval: '1h',
      aggregation: 'avg'
    })
  });
  // Process and return average
};
```
