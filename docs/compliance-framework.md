# Manufacturing Standards Compliance Framework

## Overview

The Manufacturing Standards Compliance Framework provides a structured approach to managing and enforcing compliance with industry standards in the Hybrid Manufacturing Intelligence Platform. This framework enables organizations to assess, monitor, and maintain compliance with standards such as ISO 14224, ISO 22400, ISA-95, and others.

## Core Components

### 1. Compliance Registry

The Compliance Registry manages the catalog of standards, requirements, and compliance profiles:

- **Standards Management**: Register and retrieve manufacturing standards
- **Requirements Management**: Track requirements within standards
- **Profile Management**: Create and manage compliance profiles that group requirements

### 2. Compliance Checker

The Compliance Checker provides mechanisms to verify compliance with requirements:

- **Compliance Checks**: Implement and execute compliance verification
- **Multiple Verification Methods**: Support automated, semi-automated, and manual checks
- **Extensibility**: Register custom compliance checks for specific requirements

### 3. Compliance Assessor

The Compliance Assessor manages assessment sessions and generates reports:

- **Assessment Management**: Create and track compliance assessment sessions
- **Assessment Execution**: Run assessments against entities
- **Report Generation**: Generate comprehensive compliance reports in multiple formats

### 4. Data Standard Manager

The Data Standard Manager handles data schemas and validation:

- **Schema Management**: Register and retrieve data schemas for manufacturing data
- **Data Validation**: Validate data against standard schemas
- **Data Transformation**: Transform data between different standards

### 5. Terminology Manager

The Terminology Manager standardizes manufacturing terminology:

- **Term Management**: Register and retrieve standardized manufacturing terms
- **Term Search**: Search for terms by name, alias, or content
- **Related Terms**: Find related terms based on relationships

## Supported Standards

The framework supports various manufacturing standards, including:

### 1. Equipment and Reliability Standards

- **ISO 14224**: Petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries — Collection and exchange of reliability and maintenance data for equipment
- **ISO 55000**: Asset management

### 2. Manufacturing Operations Standards

- **ISO 22400**: Automation systems and integration — Key performance indicators (KPIs) for manufacturing operations management
- **ISA-95**: Enterprise-Control System Integration
- **ISA-88**: Batch Control

### 3. Quality Standards

- **ISO 9001**: Quality management systems
- **ISO 13485**: Medical devices — Quality management systems

### 4. Industry-Specific Standards

- **IATF 16949**: Automotive quality management
- **GMP**: Good Manufacturing Practice for pharmaceutical and food manufacturing

## Compliance Profiles

Compliance profiles group requirements from different standards for specific use cases:

- **Manufacturing Execution**: Key requirements for manufacturing execution systems
- **OEE Monitoring**: Requirements for accurate OEE calculation and reporting
- **Equipment Maintenance**: Requirements for maintenance management
- **Quality Assurance**: Requirements for quality management systems

## Assessment Process

The framework supports a structured assessment process:

1. **Profile Selection**: Choose the compliance profile to assess against
2. **Assessment Setup**: Configure the assessment parameters
3. **Check Execution**: Run compliance checks for all requirements
4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze compliance status and identify gaps
5. **Report Generation**: Generate comprehensive compliance reports
6. **Remediation Planning**: Plan actions to address compliance gaps

## Compliance Check Types

The framework supports different types of compliance checks:

### 1. Automated Checks

Automated checks run without human intervention:
- Data schema validation
- Calculation correctness
- Configuration verification
- Data integrity checks

### 2. Semi-Automated Checks

Semi-automated checks require some human input:
- Process verification with approval
- Document reviews with guided questions
- Visual inspections with guided checklists

### 3. Manual Checks

Manual checks require human judgment:
- Policy reviews
- Training verifications
- Physical inspections
- Document assessments

## Integration with Platform Components

The compliance framework integrates with other platform components:

### 1. Equipment Service

- Validate equipment data against standards
- Assess equipment maintenance practices
- Verify equipment hierarchy structures

### 2. Metrics Service

- Validate metric calculations against ISO 22400
- Ensure KPI definitions meet standards
- Verify data collection methodologies

### 3. AI Service

- Assist in interpreting standards
- Provide guidance on compliance requirements
- Help analyze compliance gaps

### 4. Event System

- Publish compliance events
- React to compliance-related changes
- Trigger compliance assessments

## Usage Examples

### 1. Registering a Standard

```typescript
await complianceService.getRegistry().registerStandard({
  id: 'ISO-22400',
  name: 'ISO 22400',
  version: '2018',
  type: ComplianceStandardType.ISO,
  description: 'Automation systems and integration — Key performance indicators (KPIs) for manufacturing operations management',
  scope: 'Manufacturing operations management',
  categories: ['KPI', 'Metrics', 'Manufacturing Operations'],
  documentationUrl: 'https://www.iso.org/standard/70856.html',
});
```

### 2. Creating a Compliance Profile

```typescript
const profile = await complianceService.initializeStandardProfile(
  ['ISO-22400', 'ISA-95'],
  'Manufacturing Execution Compliance',
  'Compliance profile for manufacturing execution systems'
);
```

### 3. Running a Compliance Assessment

```typescript
// Create assessment
const assessment = await complianceService.getAssessor().createAssessment(
  profile.id,
  'Annual MES Compliance Assessment',
  'Annual compliance assessment of the manufacturing execution system'
);

// Run assessment
const results = await complianceService.getAssessor().runAssessment(
  assessment.id,
  { entityType: 'System', entityId: 'MES-001' }
);

// Generate report
const report = await complianceService.getAssessor().generateReport(
  assessment.id,
  'pdf'
);
```

### 4. Validating Data Against a Standard

```typescript
const validationResult = await complianceService.getDataStandardManager().validateData(
  'ISO-14224',
  equipmentData,
  'EquipmentUnit'
);

if (!validationResult.valid) {
  console.error('Data validation errors:', validationResult.errors);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Standards Selection**: Focus on standards most relevant to your industry and operations
2. **Requirement Prioritization**: Prioritize requirements based on criticality and impact
3. **Regular Assessments**: Conduct compliance assessments on a regular schedule
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous compliance monitoring for critical requirements
5. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of compliance activities
6. **Integration**: Integrate compliance into daily operations and decision-making
7. **Training**: Ensure staff understands relevant standards and compliance requirements

## Conclusion

The Manufacturing Standards Compliance Framework provides a comprehensive approach to managing compliance with industry standards. By integrating compliance into the platform architecture, organizations can ensure their manufacturing operations meet industry best practices and regulatory requirements while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.
