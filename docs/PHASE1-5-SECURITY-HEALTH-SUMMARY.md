# Phase 1.5: Security & Health - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 1.5 has been successfully completed. The implementation adds comprehensive security features including JWT authentication (already existed), rate limiting, audit logging, and health/metrics endpoints to ensure the platform is production-ready.

## Components Created

### 1. **Rate Limiting Middleware** (`/src/lib/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`)
- **Configurable Rate Limiters**:
  - `api`: Default 100 requests/minute
  - `auth`: 10 requests/minute for auth endpoints
  - `metrics`: 200 requests/minute for metrics
  - `websocket`: 1000 requests/minute for WebSocket
- **Client Identification**: Uses JWT user ID when available, falls back to IP
- **Rate Limit Headers**: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
- **429 Response**: Returns proper "Too Many Requests" with retry information
- **Route-specific limiting**: Different limits for different endpoints

### 2. **Audit Log Service** (`/src/services/auditLogService.ts`)
- **Comprehensive Event Tracking**:
  - Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
  - Dashboard actions (view, create, update, delete, export)
  - Data access (queries, exports, metrics views)
  - Filter changes (time range, equipment filters)
  - API access and errors
  - Admin actions (user management, permissions)
- **Rich Context Capture**:
  - User information (ID, email, role)
  - Request details (IP, user agent, path, method)
  - Resource information (type, ID, name)
  - Change tracking (previous/new values)
  - Performance metrics (response times)
- **Features**:
  - Batch writing for performance
  - Query interface with filtering
  - Statistics aggregation
  - CSV export for compliance
  - Retention policy (90 days default)

### 3. **Health Check Endpoint** (`/src/app/api/health/route.ts`)
- **Service Checks**:
  - Database connectivity and pool stats
  - Ollama AI service availability
  - Response time tracking
- **Status Levels**: healthy, degraded, unhealthy
- **Critical Service Detection**: Database marked as critical
- **Liveness Check**: HEAD method for simple ping

### 4. **Metrics Endpoint** (`/src/app/api/metrics/route.ts`)
- **System Metrics**:
  - Memory usage (used, total, percentage)
  - CPU usage
  - Process uptime
- **Database Metrics**:
  - Connection pool stats (open, idle, used)
  - Query statistics (total, duration percentiles)
- **Manufacturing Metrics**:
  - Equipment status (total, active, offline)
  - Alert counts by severity
  - Production stats (units, defects, OEE)
- **Security Metrics**:
  - Active users count
  - Failed login attempts (24h)
  - Rate limit violations (24h)
- **Prometheus Format**: Supports ?format=prometheus for monitoring integration

### 5. **Middleware Updates** (`/src/middleware.ts`)
- Integrated rate limiting for all API routes
- Rate limit headers added to successful responses
- Audit logging for rate limit violations
- Request ID generation for tracking

### 6. **Dashboard API Audit Integration**
- All dashboard endpoints now log audit events
- Tracks views, creates, updates, deletes, exports
- Records performance metrics
- Captures failed access attempts

## Security Features Summary

### Rate Limiting
✅ 100 requests/minute default limit
✅ Stricter limits for auth endpoints (10/min)
✅ Higher limits for metrics/WebSocket
✅ Per-user tracking when authenticated
✅ Graceful degradation with clear headers

### Audit Logging
✅ Every dashboard view logged
✅ All CRUD operations tracked
✅ Filter/parameter changes recorded
✅ Failed access attempts logged
✅ Performance metrics captured
✅ 90-day retention with cleanup

### Health Monitoring
✅ /api/health endpoint for liveness checks
✅ Service dependency health checks
✅ Response time tracking
✅ Degraded state detection

### Metrics & Observability
✅ /api/metrics endpoint for Prometheus
✅ System resource metrics
✅ Application performance metrics
✅ Manufacturing KPIs exposed
✅ Security metrics tracked

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Rate limiting can be configured via code
RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL=60000  # 1 minute
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Audit log retention
AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90
```

### Rate Limit Customization
```typescript
// Different limits for different endpoints
const rateLimiters = {
  api: createRateLimiter({ maxRequests: 100 }),
  auth: createRateLimiter({ maxRequests: 10 }),
  metrics: createRateLimiter({ maxRequests: 200 }),
  websocket: createRateLimiter({ maxRequests: 1000 })
};
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Exceed rate limit
for i in {1..101}; do curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards; done
# Should get 429 after 100 requests
```

### Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","checks":{...}}
```

### Test Metrics Endpoint
```bash
# JSON format
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics

# Prometheus format
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics?format=prometheus
```

### View Audit Logs
```typescript
// Query recent dashboard views
const logs = await auditLogService.query({
  action: AuditAction.DASHBOARD_VIEW,
  startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000),
  limit: 100
});
```

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 (Stabilize & Harden) now complete, the platform has:
- ✅ Real-time data connectivity with WebSocket/polling
- ✅ Configurable update intervals
- ✅ Comprehensive error & loading states
- ✅ Mobile & responsive design
- ✅ Security with rate limiting & audit logging

Phase 2 will focus on feature completion:
- Drill-down views with detailed history
- Export & annotation capabilities
- UI enhancements (dark mode, thresholds)
- Data architecture improvements

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers (auth, rate limit, audit)
2. **Fail Secure**: Deny by default, explicit allows
3. **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics for observability
4. **Compliance Ready**: Full audit trail with retention
5. **Performance**: Efficient caching and batching
6. **User Privacy**: IP addresses hashed in logs

## Phase Status
**Phase 1.5: COMPLETED ✅**

**All Phase 1 Tasks: COMPLETED ✅**
