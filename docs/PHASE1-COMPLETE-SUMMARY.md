### ✅ Phase 1.5: Security & Health
**Goal**: Implement JWT auth, rate limiting, audit logging, health endpoints

**Implemented**:
- **Rate Limiting** (`/src/lib/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`)
  - 100 req/min default (configurable by endpoint)
  - LRU cache for efficient tracking
  - User-based limiting when authenticated
  - Proper 429 responses with retry headers
