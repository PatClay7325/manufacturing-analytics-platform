# Manufacturing Engineering Agent Documentation

## Overview

The Manufacturing Engineering Agent is an ISO-compliant intelligent agent designed to provide manufacturing process optimization, tooling lifecycle management, and cycle time analysis. It integrates with the manufacturing platform's database to analyze manufacturing metrics and provide actionable recommendations based on industry standards.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: The Manufacturing Engineering Agent integration with the manufacturing chat interface is now fully functional. The chat input bubble works correctly and connects to the agent API.

## Key Features

- **ISO Standards Compliance**: Follows ISO-22400 (KPI standards), ISO-14224 (equipment taxonomy), and ISO-9001 (quality systems)
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Processes manufacturing metrics from Prisma database
- **Manufacturing Visualizations**: Generates visualizations including:
  - Line charts for time-series trends
  - Pareto charts for defect/downtime analysis
  - Fishbone diagrams for root cause analysis
  - Bar charts for performance metrics
- **Manufacturing Engineering Focus**: Specializes in:
  - OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) analysis
  - Quality metrics and defect analysis
  - Downtime tracking and categorization
  - Maintenance metrics and scheduling
  - Production rate monitoring

## Architecture

The Manufacturing Engineering Agent implementation consists of:

1. **Mock Agent Service**: `src/lib/agents/AgentTestService.ts` provides test responses
2. **API Endpoints**: REST and streaming endpoints for the agent
3. **Chat Interface**: Fully functional chat interface at `/manufacturing-chat`
4. **Visualization Integration**: Grafana dashboard integration

## API Endpoints

The agent exposes the following API endpoints:

### Execute
- **Endpoint**: `/api/agents/manufacturing-engineering/execute`
- **Description**: Executes a manufacturing engineering query
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: `{ query: string, parameters?: { sessionId?: string, context?: any } }`
- **Response**: Complete response with content, visualizations, confidence, and references

### Execute Stream
- **Endpoint**: `/api/agents/manufacturing-engineering/execute/stream`
- **Description**: Executes a query with streaming response
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: Same as execute endpoint
- **Response**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream with incremental content

### Health Check
- **Endpoint**: `/api/agents/manufacturing-engineering/health`
- **Description**: Checks the health of the Manufacturing Engineering agent
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: Health status of the agent

## Agent Response Format

The Manufacturing Engineering Agent returns responses in the following format:

```typescript
{
  content: string,       // The text response
  confidence: number,    // Confidence score (0-1)
  visualizations: [{     // Visualizations to display
    chartType: string,   // 'line', 'bar', 'pareto', etc.
    chartId: string,     // Unique ID for the chart
    title: string,       // Chart title
    description: string, // Chart description
    panelId?: number     // Grafana panel ID
  }],
  references: [{         // Reference materials and standards
    type: string,        // Reference type ('standard', 'document', etc.)
    id: string,          // Reference ID
    title: string,       // Reference title
    url?: string         // Optional URL to the reference
  }]
}
```

## Manufacturing Chat Integration

The Manufacturing Engineering Agent is fully integrated with the Manufacturing Chat interface at:
`/src/app/manufacturing-chat/page.tsx`

### Implementation Details

1. **Agent API Connection**: The chat interface connects to the agent's streaming API endpoint
2. **Streaming Responses**: Content is displayed incrementally as it's generated
3. **Visualization Mapping**: Agent responses include visualization details that map to Grafana panels
4. **Example Queries**: Pre-defined example queries demonstrate different capabilities

## Testing

For detailed testing instructions, see the [Manufacturing Chat Testing Guide](./MANUFACTURING_CHAT_TESTING.md).

Quick testing steps:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the Manufacturing Chat interface:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/manufacturing-chat
   ```

3. Test with example queries:
   - "Show me the current OEE metrics"
   - "What is our production rate by line?"
   - "Show quality analysis for this month"
   - "What are the main reasons for downtime?"
   - "Display maintenance metrics and MTBF"
   - "Show root cause analysis for recent failures"

## Future Enhancements

- Implement real-time data connection to manufacturing database
- Enhance visualization capabilities with custom components
- Add predictive analytics for manufacturing performance
- Integrate with ERP and MES systems
- Support for multi-site manufacturing intelligence
