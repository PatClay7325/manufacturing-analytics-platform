## Overview

The Manufacturing Analytics Platform requires a robust testing strategy to ensure:
- High reliability of critical manufacturing data and analytics
- Accurate real-time monitoring and alerting
- Seamless user experience across all features
- Data integrity and security
- Performance under high data loads

## Testing Principles

1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Test early and often in the development cycle
2. **Test Automation First**: Prioritize automated tests over manual testing
3. **Fast Feedback**: Tests should run quickly to provide immediate feedback
4. **Isolated Tests**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
5. **Meaningful Coverage**: Focus on critical paths and business logic
6. **Test as Documentation**: Tests should serve as living documentation

## Testing Pyramid

```
        /\
       /  \
      / E2E \     (10% - Critical user journeys)
     /______\
    /        \
   /Integration\  (30% - API and component integration)
  /____________\
 /              \
/  Unit Tests    \ (60% - Business logic and components)
/________________\
```

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing (60% of tests)

**Purpose**: Test individual components and functions in isolation

**Scope**:
- React components
- Utility functions
- Data transformations
- State management logic
- Custom hooks

**Tools**: Vitest, React Testing Library

**Example Test Areas**:
```typescript
// Component tests
- Dashboard component renders correctly
- KPI cards display correct data
- Alert badges show proper status

// Utility tests
- Data formatting functions
- Date/time calculations
- Statistical calculations (OEE, performance metrics)

// Hook tests
- useEquipmentData fetches and returns data
- useAlerts manages alert state
- useWebSocket handles real-time connections
```

### 2. Integration Testing (30% of tests)

**Purpose**: Test how different parts of the application work together

**Scope**:
- API integration
- Component integration
- State management integration
- Database interactions

**Tools**: Vitest, MSW (Mock Service Worker)

**Example Test Areas**:
```typescript
// API Integration
- Equipment API returns correct data format
- Alert creation and updates
- Authentication flow

// Component Integration
- Dashboard with real-time data updates
- Form submissions with API calls
- Navigation between features

// State Management
- Global state updates across components
- Data persistence
- Error state handling
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing (10% of tests)

**Purpose**: Test complete user workflows in a real browser environment

**Scope**:
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance under load

**Tools**: Playwright

**Critical User Journeys**:
1. **Dashboard Monitoring Flow**
   - Login → View Dashboard → Check KPIs → Drill into details
   
2. **Alert Management Flow**
   - Receive alert → View details → Acknowledge → Resolve

3. **Equipment Analysis Flow**
   - Select equipment → View metrics → Analyze trends → Export data

4. **AI Assistant Flow**
   - Ask question → Receive response → Follow suggestions

## Test Coverage Goals

### Overall Coverage Target: 80%

**Critical Areas (>90% coverage)**:
- Manufacturing calculations (OEE, availability, performance)
- Alert logic and notifications
- Data transformations
- Authentication and authorization

**Standard Areas (>80% coverage)**:
- UI components
- API handlers
- State management
- Utility functions

**Lower Priority (>60% coverage)**:
- Static pages
- Style utilities
- Configuration files

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Unit & Integration Testing
```json
{
  "framework": "Vitest",
  "assertion": "Vitest built-in + @testing-library/jest-dom",
  "component": "@testing-library/react",
  "mocking": "Vitest mocks + MSW",
  "coverage": "@vitest/coverage-v8"
}
```

### E2E Testing
```json
{
  "framework": "Playwright",
  "browsers": ["chromium", "firefox", "webkit"],
  "mobile": ["Pixel 5", "iPhone 12"],
  "reporting": "HTML reports + screenshots on failure"
}
```

### Performance Testing
```json
{
  "metrics": "Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)",
  "tools": "Lighthouse CI, bundle analyzer",
  "monitoring": "Real User Monitoring (RUM)"
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
```yaml
- Linting (ESLint)
- Formatting (Prettier)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- Unit tests for changed files
```

### Pull Request Checks
```yaml
- Full unit test suite
- Integration tests
- E2E smoke tests
- Code coverage report
- Bundle size analysis
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
Development:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - E2E smoke tests

Staging:
  - Full E2E test suite
  - Performance tests
  - Security scans

Production:
  - Smoke tests post-deployment
  - Synthetic monitoring
  - Real user monitoring
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Component/Feature Name', () => {
  // Arrange shared setup
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  describe('when condition/scenario', () => {
    it('should expected behavior', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act
      // Assert
    });
  });
});
```

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- E2E files: `*.spec.ts`
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

### 3. Data Management
- Use factories for test data generation
- Avoid hardcoded test data
- Clean up test data after tests

### 4. Mocking Strategy
- Mock external dependencies
- Use MSW for API mocking
- Prefer real implementations over mocks when possible

### 5. Accessibility Testing
- Include accessibility checks in component tests
- Use Playwright's accessibility testing features
- Test keyboard navigation and screen readers

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Set performance budgets
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Monitor test execution time
