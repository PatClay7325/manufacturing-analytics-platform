# Modular Services Architecture

## Overview

The Hybrid Manufacturing Intelligence Platform implements a modular services architecture that enables flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. This document explains the key components and patterns used in the services system.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Service

A Service is a self-contained component that provides specific functionality within the platform. Each service:

- Has a unique name and version
- Implements a well-defined interface
- Manages its own lifecycle (initialization, start, stop)
- Provides health checks and metrics
- Exposes capabilities that can be enabled or disabled
- Declares dependencies on other services

### 2. Service Interfaces

Service interfaces define the contract between service providers and consumers. They specify:

- Operations that the service supports
- Input and output parameters for each operation
- Error handling behaviors
- Events that the service may emit

### 3. Service Implementation

Service implementations provide the actual functionality behind the service interfaces. They:

- Implement all operations defined in the interface
- Handle errors and edge cases
- Emit events when significant actions occur
- Track metrics and health information
- Manage resources (database connections, caches, etc.)

### 4. Service Factory

The Service Factory is responsible for:

- Creating service instances
- Managing service lifecycle
- Resolving service dependencies
- Providing access to services

### 5. Service Registry

The Service Registry maintains a catalog of all available services and enables:

- Service discovery
- Status monitoring
- Dependency tracking

## Service Types

The platform includes the following core services:

### 1. Equipment Service

Manages equipment entities and their lifecycle:
- Equipment registration
- Status management
- History tracking
- Relationship management (production lines, maintenance records, etc.)

### 2. Metrics Service

Handles performance metrics and Analytics:
- OEE calculation and tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Trend analysis
- Statistical calculations

### 3. Maintenance Service

Manages maintenance activities:
- Maintenance scheduling
- Maintenance record tracking
- Predictive maintenance recommendations
- Spare parts management

### 4. Quality Service

Handles quality assurance and control:
- Quality check recording
- Defect tracking and analysis
- Statistical process control
- Quality metrics calculation

### 5. Alerts Service

Manages alerts and notifications:
- Alert generation
- Severity classification
- Alert lifecycle management
- Notification delivery

## Service Capabilities

Services expose capabilities that can be enabled or disabled based on configuration. For example:

- Equipment Service
  - Basic equipment management
  - Equipment status tracking
  - Equipment history
  - Predictive maintenance

- Metrics Service
  - Basic metrics
  - Advanced Analytics
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Trend prediction

Capabilities can have dependencies on other capabilities or services, allowing for flexible configuration based on available resources.

## Service Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**
   - Service is created and configured
   - Resources are allocated
   - Dependencies are resolved

2. **Starting**
   - Service starts accepting requests
   - Event listeners are registered
   - Background tasks are initiated

3. **Running**
   - Service processes requests
   - Emits events
   - Reports health and metrics

4. **Stopping**
   - Service stops accepting new requests
   - In-flight requests are completed
   - Resources are released

5. **Shutdown**
   - Service performs cleanup
   - Connections are closed
   - Resources are freed

## Service Communication

Services communicate through several mechanisms:

1. **Direct Method Calls**
   - For synchronous, in-process communication
   - Used when tight coupling is acceptable

2. **Events**
   - For asynchronous, loosely-coupled communication
   - Used for notifications and state changes

3. **API Calls**
   - For remote communication between services
   - Used when services are deployed separately

## Service Configuration

Services are configured through:

1. **Environment-specific configuration**
   - Development, staging, production settings

2. **Capability enablement**
   - Enabling or disabling specific capabilities

3. **Dependency configuration**
   - Specifying how to connect to dependencies

4. **Resource limits**
   - Memory, CPU, and connection limits

## Service Metrics and Health

Services provide:

1. **Health Checks**
   - Overall service status
   - Dependency health
   - Resource utilization

2. **Metrics**
   - Request counts and latencies
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage
   - Business-specific metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Service Design**
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Define clear interfaces
   - Minimize dependencies between services
   - Provide sensible defaults

2. **Error Handling**
   - Return structured error responses
   - Include error codes and messages
   - Log detailed error information
   - Implement graceful degradation

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize critical paths
   - Use caching where appropriate
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Monitor and track performance metrics

4. **Testing**
   - Unit test service implementations
   - Mock dependencies for isolation
   - Test error handling paths
   - Verify metrics and health reporting

## Conclusion

The modular services architecture provides the foundation for a flexible, maintainable, and scalable platform. By encapsulating functionality in well-defined services with clear interfaces, the system can evolve independently while maintaining consistency and reliability.
