# Test Status Report - Manufacturing Analytics Platform

## Executive Summary

**Overall Test Status: ❌ NOT ALL PASSING**

The project has a comprehensive test suite with Vitest for unit/integration tests and Playwright for E2E tests. However, several tests are currently failing due to schema mismatches, missing imports, and placeholder implementations.

## Detailed Test Analysis

### 1. Unit Tests (Vitest) 

#### ✅ Passing Tests:
- **Basic Tests** (`src/__tests__/basic.test.ts`) - 2/2 passing
- **Manufacturing Calculations** (`src/__tests__/utils/manufacturingCalculations.test.ts`) - All passing
  - OEE calculations
  - MTBF calculations
  - MTTR calculations
  - Shift time calculations
- **Component Tests**:
  - `Card.test.tsx` - Rendering and prop tests passing
  - `AlertItem.test.tsx` - Complete component tests passing
  - `KPICard.test.tsx` - Tests implemented and passing

#### ❌ Failing/Issues:
- **useEquipmentData Hook** (`src/__tests__/hooks/useEquipmentData.test.ts`)
  - Only has placeholder tests: `expect(true).toBe(true)`
  - Needs actual implementation
- **Home Page Test** (`testing/unit/home.test.tsx`)
  - Missing import: `vi` from 'vitest'
  - Will fail when run

### 2. Integration Tests (Vitest)

#### ❌ Major Issues:
All integration tests are failing due to:

1. **Database Schema Mismatches**:
   - Test trying to use `specifications` field on Equipment (doesn't exist)
   - Test trying to use `productionLineId` directly on Equipment (should use relation)
   - Test trying to use `measurements` field on QualityCheck (doesn't exist)
   - Test trying to use `metadata` field on Metric (doesn't exist)

2. **Missing Required Fields**:
   - `installationDate` missing when creating Equipment
   - Various other required fields not provided

3. **Data Validation Errors**:
   - Unique constraint violations
   - Foreign key constraint violations
   - Test expectations not matching actual data

#### Failed Test Suites:
- `database.integration.test.ts` - 6/11 tests failing
- `api.integration.test.ts` - 2/4 tests failing  
- `services.integration.test.ts` - 4/4 tests failing
- `chat.integration.test.ts` - Not yet run but likely has similar issues

### 3. E2E Tests (Playwright)

#### Status Unknown:
- Tests exist but require the dev server to be running
- Test files created:
  - `navigation.spec.ts`
  - `equipment.spec.ts`
  - `manufacturing-chat.spec.ts` (new)
  - Additional tests in `testing/e2e/` directory

#### Configuration Issues:
- Tests split between `tests/e2e/` and `testing/e2e/` directories
- Playwright configured to only look in `tests/e2e/`

## Root Causes

### 1. Schema Evolution
The Prisma schema has evolved but tests weren't updated to match:
- Equipment model changed
- QualityCheck model structure different
- Metric model has different fields

### 2. Test Data Factories
The `createTestEquipment` helper and other factories need updating to match current schema

### 3. Import Issues
Some test files have missing imports (specifically `vi` from vitest)

### 4. Placeholder Tests
Some tests were created as placeholders and never implemented

## Fixes Required

### Immediate Fixes Needed:

1. **Fix Import in home.test.tsx**:
```typescript
import { vi } from 'vitest'; // Add this line
```

2. **Update createTestEquipment in setup-integration.ts**:
- Already fixed to include `installationDate`
- Need to remove invalid fields from tests

3. **Fix Integration Test Data**:
- Remove `specifications` field usage
- Remove `measurements` field from QualityCheck
- Remove `metadata` field from Metric
- Fix equipment-production line relationships

4. **Implement Placeholder Tests**:
- Complete `useEquipmentData.test.ts` with actual tests

### Commands to Run Tests:

```bash
# Unit tests only (some will pass)
npm run test:unit -- --run

# Integration tests (currently failing)
npm run test:integration -- --run

# E2E tests (requires dev server)
npm run dev # In one terminal
npm run test:e2e # In another terminal

# Chat-specific tests
npm run test:chat # Playwright
npm run test:chat:api # API test
```

## Summary

- **Unit Tests**: ~70% passing (component and utility tests work, some placeholders)
- **Integration Tests**: 0% passing (all failing due to schema mismatches)
- **E2E Tests**: Unknown (not run, but likely functional with dev server)

**Total Estimate: ~40% of tests passing**

The test infrastructure is solid, but significant work is needed to update tests to match the current database schema. The good news is that these are mostly data structure issues rather than fundamental test architecture problems.
