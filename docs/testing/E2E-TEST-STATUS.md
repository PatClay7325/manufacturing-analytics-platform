# E2E Test Status Report

## Current Status
- Fixed several test issues but encountering page loading problems
- Tests are experiencing infinite reload loops causing timeouts

## Issues Fixed
1. **Alert filter tests**: Updated to use correct selectors
2. **View Details links**: Changed to use href pattern matching
3. **Navigation tests**: Added proper wait times for mobile menu
4. **Chat URL patterns**: Updated to match actual ID formats

## Remaining Issues
1. **Page loading**: Tests timeout waiting for page to load
2. **Title check**: Page title is empty suggesting rendering issues
3. **Infinite reload**: Logs show continuous page reloads

## Recommendations
1. Check if there's a redirect loop in the application
2. Verify the dev server is running correctly
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Consider running tests with `--debug` flag to see what's happening

## Test Commands
```cmd
# Run tests sequentially (recommended)
run-tests-sequential.cmd

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/alerts.spec.ts --debug

# Check only fixed tests
run-e2e-tests-fix-check.cmd
```

## Next Steps
1. Debug the page loading issue
2. Check for console errors in the browser
3. Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
4. Consider adding more robust error handling in tests
