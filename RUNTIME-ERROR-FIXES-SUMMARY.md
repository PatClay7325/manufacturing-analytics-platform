# Runtime Error Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-01-06

### Fixes Applied

1. **SVG Path Syntax Errors**
   - Fixed 18 instances of invalid SVG path syntax (`h?.01` → `h.01`)
   - Affected files:
     - Components: ErrorAlert, ChatErrorStates, AnalyticsPanel, AlertCard, AlertTimeline
     - Pages: alerts, equipment, manufacturing-chat
   - Error was causing: "Unexpected token ?.01" in browser console

2. **Analytics Server Connection Handling**
   - Fixed undefined variable reference in AnalyticsPanel component
   - Changed error handling to gracefully handle Analytics server unavailability
   - Error messages now clearly indicate that Analytics server should run on port 3002
   - Connection failures are handled silently in development mode

3. **Malformed className Attribute**
   - Fixed malformed className in AnalyticsPanel: `bg-red-900 />20` → `bg-red-900/20`
   - This was causing invalid HTML rendering

4. **ParetoChart Reference Line Error**
   - Previously fixed: Changed ReferenceLine from using numeric x values to category names
   - This resolves the "yAxis domain configuration" errors

### Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
- SVG icons should render correctly without console errors
- Analytics panels will show a clean error message when Analytics server is not available
- No more "Unexpected token" errors in the browser console
- ParetoChart component will render without yAxis configuration errors

### Testing Recommendations

1. Clear browser cache and restart the development server
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify that all pages load without JavaScript errors
4. Confirm that Analytics panels show appropriate error messages when server is unavailable

### Notes

- The Analytics server (port 3002) is optional for development
- All error handling has been improved to fail gracefully
- SVG path syntax has been standardized across all components
