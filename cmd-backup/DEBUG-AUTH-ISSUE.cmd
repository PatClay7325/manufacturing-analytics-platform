echo Debugging Auth Context Issue
echo ==========================================
echo.

echo SOLUTION:
echo The auth context issue should now be fixed!
echo.

echo The AuthContext has been updated to:
echo 1. Auto-login with a mock user in development mode
echo 2. Skip API calls and redirects in development
echo 3. No longer require a backend server
echo.

echo Please try the following:
echo.
echo 1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
echo 2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
echo 3. Make sure the dev server is restarted
echo.

echo If you still see the error, try:
echo   npm run dev
echo   (wait for it to fully start)
echo   Then visit: http://localhost:3000/Analytics-dashboard
echo.

echo The mock user credentials are:
echo   Email: admin@manufacturing.com
echo   Name: Admin User
echo   Role: admin
echo.
