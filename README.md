## 🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: REAL DATA ONLY 🚨

**THIS POC MUST USE REAL DATA FROM THE DATABASE**
- ❌ **NEVER** use mock data, sample data, or generated data
- ❌ **NEVER** use hardcoded responses or simulated values  
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use real data from TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL
- ✅ **ALWAYS** query actual production data

**Mock data destroys the entire purpose of this POC - demonstrating real manufacturing analytics.**

---

A clean, modern web application for manufacturing intelligence and Analytics built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

- **Adaptive Factory Analytics Engine**: Complete Analytics-parallel functionality
  - Custom dashboards with drag-and-drop panels
  - Time-series visualization with Recharts
  - Real-time data streaming via WebSocket
  - Template-based dashboard creation
  - Multi-level data aggregation
  - Performance optimized with TimescaleDB

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/manufacturing-intelligence-platform.git
   cd manufacturing-intelligence-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Initialize the Mock Service Worker:
   ```bash
   npm run msw:init
   # or
   yarn msw:init
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Mock API Server

The project includes a mock API server that intercepts API requests during development and returns mock data. This allows for frontend development without requiring a backend server.

- Mock data files are located in `src/mocks/data/`
- API handlers are defined in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`
- The mock server is automatically initialized in development mode

To add new mock endpoints:
1. Add mock data in `src/mocks/data/`
2. Add handlers in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`
3. No restart is needed - changes will be reflected automatically

## Development Workflow

This project follows a structured development workflow:

1. **Branch Strategy**:
   - `main-Production-ready-code`: Production-ready code
   - `develop-Integration-branch`: Integration branch for completed features
   - `feature/*`: New feature development
   - `bugfix/*`: Bug corrections
   - `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated testing and building on all branches
   - Automated deployment to staging from `develop-Integration-branch`
   - Automated deployment to production from `main-Production-ready-code`
   - See [CICD-GUIDE.md](CICD-GUIDE.md) for details

3. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Create feature branches from `develop-Integration-branch`
   - Submit PRs back to `develop-Integration-branch`
   - After testing in staging, create PR from `develop-Integration-branch` to `main-Production-ready-code`

## Design Principles

This project follows these key design principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data access.
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential packages are included to reduce bloat and maintenance burden.
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.
4. **Component-Based Design**: UI is built with reusable React components following best practices.
5. **Responsive Design**: All pages are responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Benefits of Clean Architecture

1. **No Bloat**: Started from scratch without any template bloat
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only includes what's actually needed
3. **Modern Patterns**: Uses latest React and Next.js patterns
4. **Performance**: Fast and lightweight
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and extend

## Development Approach

This project was built from scratch with a focus on simplicity and maintainability:

1. Started with a clean Next.js App Router structure
2. Added Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Created essential page components (Home, Dashboard, Equipment, Alerts, Chat)
4. Implemented responsive layouts and UI components
5. Added mock data for demonstration purposes

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Authentication and user management
- [ ] Database integration with Prisma
- [ ] Real-time data updates
- [ ] Integration with manufacturing systems
- [ ] Advanced Analytics and reporting
- [ ] Production deployment setup

## Folder Structure Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality in dedicated folders
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep business logic separate from UI components
- Organize CSS using Tailwind's utility-first approach
