## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Daily Standups (15 min)
```
- What did you complete yesterday?
- What will you work on today?
- Any blockers?
- Key metrics update
```

### 2. Weekly Customer Demos
```
Every Friday at 2 PM:
- Live demo of new features
- Feedback collection
- Priority adjustments
- Next week preview
```

### 3. Code Quality Standards
```typescript
// All code must include:
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Unit tests (>80% coverage)
- Integration tests for APIs
- JSDoc comments
- Error handling
- Logging

// Example standard:
/**
 * Extracts equipment data from SAP
 * @param plant - SAP plant code
 * @returns Array of equipment records
 * @throws SAPConnectionError
 */
export async function extractEquipment(plant: string): Promise<Equipment[]> {
  try {
    logger.info('Extracting equipment data', { plant });
    const data = await sapConnector.execute('BAPI_EQUI_GETLIST', { PLANT: plant });
    logger.info('Equipment extraction complete', { count: data.length });
    return data.map(transformEquipment);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Equipment extraction failed', { plant, error });
    throw new SAPConnectionError('Failed to extract equipment data', { cause: error });
  }
}
```

### 4. Testing Strategy
```yaml
Unit Tests:
  - Every function/component
  - Mock external dependencies
  - Run on every commit

Integration Tests:
  - API endpoints
  - Database operations
  - External connectors
  - Run before merge

E2E Tests:
  - Critical user journeys
  - Cross-browser testing
  - Run before deployment

Performance Tests:
  - Load testing (k6)
  - Query performance
  - Memory profiling
  - Run weekly
```

### 5. Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| SAP integration complexity | Early spike in Week 1 | Use batch file import |
| AI response accuracy | Extensive prompt testing | Fallback to templates |
| Performance at scale | Early load testing | Implement caching |
| Security vulnerabilities | Week 9 pen testing | Fix before go-live |
| Customer adoption | Weekly demos | Adjust UI/UX based on feedback |
