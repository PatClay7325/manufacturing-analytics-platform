# Risk Mitigation Strategy - ISO-Compliant AI Analytics Platform

## Executive Summary

This document identifies key risks to the project success and provides concrete mitigation strategies with clear ownership and timelines. Each risk includes early warning indicators and contingency plans.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

```
Impact Scale: 1 (Low) to 5 (Critical)
Probability: 1 (Unlikely) to 5 (Very Likely)
Risk Score = Impact × Probability
```

## Technical Risks

### 1. SAP Integration Complexity
**Risk Score: 20 (Impact: 5, Probability: 4)**

#### Description
SAP systems vary significantly between customers. BAPIs might be customized, authorization may be restricted, or performance could be poor.

#### Early Warning Signs
- BAPI documentation doesn't match reality
- Test system behaves differently than described
- Response times > 30 seconds for basic queries
- Missing authorizations discovered during testing

#### Mitigation Strategy
```typescript
// Week 1: Integration Spike
export class SAPIntegrationSpike {
  async validate(): Promise<ValidationReport> {
    const tests = [
      this.testBasicConnectivity(),
      this.testBAPIAvailability(),
      this.testDataVolumes(),
      this.testPerformance(),
      this.testAuthorizations()
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(tests);
    return this.generateReport(results);
  }
  
  private async testBAPIAvailability() {
    const requiredBAPIs = [
      'BAPI_EQUI_GETLIST',
      'BAPI_PRODORD_GET_LIST',
      'BAPI_MATERIAL_GET_ALL'
    ];
    
    for (const bapi of requiredBAPIs) {
      try {
        await this.sap.functionModuleExists(bapi);
      } catch (error) {
        return {
          status: 'failed',
          bapi,
          fallback: this.getFallbackStrategy(bapi)
        };
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Plan A**: Use standard BAPIs with customer's help
2. **Plan B**: Use OData services if available
3. **Plan C**: Direct database views (read-only)
4. **Plan D**: Scheduled CSV exports from SAP

#### Owner: Backend Developer + Customer IT
#### Timeline: Week 1 spike must complete before Week 3

---

### 2. Ignition Data Volume
**Risk Score: 12 (Impact: 4, Probability: 3)**

#### Description
Historical data in Ignition can be massive (billions of rows), making queries slow and storage expensive.

#### Early Warning Signs
- Tag count > 10,000
- Historical data > 5 years
- Query times > 10 seconds
- Database size > 1TB

#### Mitigation Strategy
```sql
-- Implement data partitioning and aggregation strategy
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_metrics AS
SELECT 
  date_trunc('hour', timestamp) as hour,
  equipment_id,
  tag_name,
  AVG(value) as avg_value,
  MIN(value) as min_value,
  MAX(value) as max_value,
  COUNT(*) as sample_count
FROM raw_metrics
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;

-- Create indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_hourly_metrics_equipment 
  ON hourly_metrics(equipment_id, hour DESC);

-- Implement data retention
ALTER TABLE raw_metrics 
  SET (timescaledb.retention_policy = '90 days');
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Plan A**: Use TimescaleDB continuous aggregates
2. **Plan B**: Implement sampling for old data
3. **Plan C**: Archive to cold storage (S3)
4. **Plan D**: Limit historical data to 1 year

#### Owner: Data Engineer
#### Timeline: Week 2 - Test with real data volumes

---

### 3. AI Response Accuracy
**Risk Score: 9 (Impact: 3, Probability: 3)**

#### Description
LLM might misinterpret queries, generate incorrect SQL, or provide inaccurate calculations.

#### Early Warning Signs
- Test queries return wrong results
- SQL syntax errors from generated queries
- Calculations don't match manual verification
- User complaints about accuracy

#### Mitigation Strategy
```typescript
// Implement query validation pipeline
export class QueryValidator {
  private validators = [
    this.validateSQLSyntax,
    this.validateTableAccess,
    this.validateRowLimits,
    this.validateCalculations
  ];
  
  async validateGeneratedQuery(query: GeneratedQuery): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Run through all validators
    for (const validator of this.validators) {
      const result = await validator(query);
      if (!result.valid) {
        return {
          valid: false,
          error: result.error,
          suggestion: this.getSuggestion(result.error)
        };
      }
    }
    
    // Test with small dataset first
    const testResult = await this.runTestQuery(query);
    return this.validateTestResult(testResult);
  }
  
  private validateCalculations(query: GeneratedQuery) {
    // For OEE calculations, ensure formula is correct
    if (query.type === 'oee_calculation') {
      const formula = query.calculation;
      const expected = 'availability * performance * quality';
      
      if (!formula.includes(expected)) {
        return {
          valid: false,
          error: 'Invalid OEE formula',
          suggestion: 'OEE must be calculated as Availability × Performance × Quality'
        };
      }
    }
    
    return { valid: true };
  }
}
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Plan A**: Pre-defined query templates for common requests
2. **Plan B**: Show generated SQL for user verification
3. **Plan C**: Limit to simple queries initially
4. **Plan D**: Manual query builder UI as fallback

#### Owner: Tech Lead
#### Timeline: Week 5-6 during AI implementation

#### Early Warning Signs
- Many NULL values in critical fields
- Timestamps in the future or distant past
- Same equipment with multiple IDs
- Production counts that exceed physical limits

#### Mitigation Strategy
```typescript
// Implement comprehensive data quality checks
export class DataQualityService {
  async analyzeDataQuality(dataset: string): Promise<QualityReport> {
    const checks = {
      completeness: await this.checkCompleteness(dataset),
      accuracy: await this.checkAccuracy(dataset),
      consistency: await this.checkConsistency(dataset),
      timeliness: await this.checkTimeliness(dataset)
    };
    
    return {
      overallScore: this.calculateScore(checks),
      issues: this.extractIssues(checks),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(checks)
    };
  }
  
  private async checkCompleteness(dataset: string) {
    const results = await prisma.$queryRaw`
      SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_records,
        SUM(CASE WHEN equipment_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_equipment,
        SUM(CASE WHEN timestamp IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_timestamp,
        SUM(CASE WHEN value IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as missing_value
      FROM ${dataset}
    `;
    
    return {
      score: this.calculateCompletenessScore(results),
      issues: this.identifyCompletenessIssues(results)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Data Cleansing Rules
```yaml
cleansing_rules:
  - name: Remove future timestamps
    condition: timestamp > NOW()
    action: exclude_record
    
  - name: Fill missing equipment IDs
    condition: equipment_id IS NULL AND equipment_name IS NOT NULL
    action: lookup_by_name
    
  - name: Standardize units
    condition: unit IN ('KG', 'kg', 'Kg')
    action: convert_to_standard('kg')
    
  - name: Remove duplicates
    condition: duplicate_key(timestamp, equipment_id, metric)
    action: keep_first
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Plan A**: Automated data cleansing pipeline
2. **Plan B**: Data quality dashboard for monitoring
3. **Plan C**: Manual review process for critical data
4. **Plan D**: Work with customer to fix at source

#### Mitigation Strategy
```typescript
// Build user-centric features
export class UserExperienceEnhancements {
  features = {
    // 1. Guided onboarding
    onboarding: {
      welcomeTour: true,
      interactiveTooltips: true,
      progressTracking: true,
      videoTutorials: true
    },
    
    // 2. Personalization

      savedQueries: true,
      customDashboards: true,
      favoriteMetrics: true,
      recentlyViewed: true
    },
    
    // 3. Export options
    exports: {
      excel: true,
      pdf: true,
      powerpoint: true,
      email: true
    },
    
    // 4. Familiar patterns
    ui: {
      excelLikeGrids: true,
      dragAndDrop: true,
      rightClickMenus: true,

## Risk Monitoring Dashboard

```typescript
// Risk monitoring implementation
export class RiskMonitor {
  async generateWeeklyReport(): Promise<RiskReport> {
    const risks = await this.assessAllRisks();
    
    return {
      summary: {
        high: risks.filter(r => r.score >= 15).length,
        medium: risks.filter(r => r.score >= 8 && r.score < 15).length,
        low: risks.filter(r => r.score < 8).length
      },
      
      trending: {
        increasing: risks.filter(r => r.trend === 'up'),
        stable: risks.filter(r => r.trend === 'stable'),
        decreasing: risks.filter(r => r.trend === 'down')
      },
      
      actionRequired: risks
        .filter(r => r.requiresAction)
        .map(r => ({
          risk: r.name,
          action: r.recommendedAction,
          owner: r.owner,
          dueDate: r.actionDueDate
        })),
      
      successMetrics: {
        mitigatedThisWeek: this.getMitigatedCount(),
        blockedFeatures: this.getBlockedFeatures(),
        scheduleImpact: this.getScheduleImpact()
      }
