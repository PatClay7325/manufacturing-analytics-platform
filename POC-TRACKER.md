## 🎯 Quick Status Check

### Are we on track for POC?
**Current Assessment:** ⚠️ **AT RISK**

**Why:** 
- ❌ No integration work started (Critical path)
- ❌ No demo data prepared
- ⚠️ UI needs drill-down capability

**Recovery Plan:**
1. **Today:** Start SAP payload simulator
2. **This Week:** Get one full data import working
3. **Next Week:** Build complete demo dataset

---

## 📋 Definition of "POC Complete"

A manufacturing plant manager can:
1. ✅ View real-time OEE for all equipment
2. ✅ Ask "What's my biggest problem?" and get accurate answer
3. ❌ Drill down from KPI → Equipment → Root Cause in 3 clicks
4. ❌ See their ERP production orders linked to OEE losses
5. ⚠️ Get actionable recommendations from AI
6. ❌ Export a one-page downtime report

**Current Score: 2.5/6 requirements met**

## 🔄 Update Instructions

1. **Daily:** Update the standup section
2. **Weekly:** Update sprint progress percentages
3. **On Completion:** Check off tasks, update progress bars
4. **On Blocker:** Add to blockers section with mitigation plan
