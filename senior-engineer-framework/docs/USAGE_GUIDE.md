## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- TypeScript 4.5+ (recommended)
- Git repository (for Git integration)

### Installation

1. The framework is already set up in your project structure under `senior-engineer-framework/`
2. Make the verification scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-file.js
```

3. Test the installation:

```bash
node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-file.js path/to/some/file.ts
```

## Verification Commands

### Verify a Single File

```bash
node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-file.js src/components/MyComponent.tsx
```

This will:
- Run comprehensive verification checks on the file
- Generate a verification report
- Output a summary of the results

### Verify Multiple Files

```bash
# Using find
find src -name "*.ts" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | xargs -I{} node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-file.js {}

# Or with a custom script
node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-directory.js src
```

### Verification Report

Each verification generates a detailed report saved to `senior-engineer-framework/reports/`. These reports include:

- Overall quality score
- Scores for individual quality dimensions
- Detailed lists of issues found
- Verification metadata (timestamp, verification ID, etc.)

## Continuous Verification

The framework includes a continuous verification engine that monitors files in real-time and verifies changes as you work.

### Start Continuous Verification

```javascript
// Example script to start continuous verification
const { ContinuousVerificationEngine } = require('./senior-engineer-framework/core/ContinuousVerificationEngine');

const engine = new ContinuousVerificationEngine({
  watchPaths: ['src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  ignorePaths: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/*.test.{ts,tsx}'],
  gitMonitoring: true,
  autoFix: true,
  reportingInterval: 3600000 // 1 hour
});

engine.start();
```

### Features of Continuous Verification

- **Real-time monitoring**: Verifies files as you save them
- **Git integration**: Blocks commits if verification fails
- **Auto-fix**: Can automatically fix certain issues
- **Periodic reporting**: Generates summary reports at specified intervals
- **Activity logging**: Records all development activities

## Git Integration

The framework integrates with Git to ensure only verified code gets committed.

### Pre-commit Hook

A pre-commit hook is installed that verifies all staged files before allowing a commit. If any file fails verification, the commit is blocked.

### Manual Override (Discouraged)

To bypass verification in exceptional cases (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your message"
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Bypassing verification is strongly discouraged and may be logged as a violation.

## Quality Metrics

The framework verifies code against multiple quality dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Type Safety | Strict typing and type correctness | 90% |
| Security | Freedom from security vulnerabilities | 95% |
| Testability | Ease of writing tests, expected coverage | 80% |
| Performance | Code efficiency and optimization | 80% |
| Accessibility | WCAG compliance and accessibility features | 80% |
| Overall Quality | Weighted combination of all dimensions | 85% |

### Understanding the Scores

- **0-50**: Poor quality, needs significant improvement
- **51-70**: Below standards, requires attention
- **71-85**: Approaching standards, minor issues
- **86-95**: Meets standards, good quality
- **96-100**: Exceeds standards, excellent quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Verification Failures

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Type safety issues | Add proper type annotations, avoid `any` |
| Security vulnerabilities | Fix identified security issues, avoid risky patterns |
| Poor testability | Refactor for dependency injection, reduce complexity |
| Performance issues | Optimize identified bottlenecks, reduce complexity |
| Accessibility failures | Add required ARIA attributes, ensure keyboard navigation |

### Verification Errors

If verification fails with an error (not just quality issues):

1. Check that TypeScript is installed if verifying TS files
2. Ensure the file exists and is readable
3. Check for syntax errors that might prevent parsing

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Verification Configuration

You can customize verification thresholds and options:

```javascript
const { QuantumVerifier } = require('./senior-engineer-framework/core/QuantumVerifier');

const verifier = new QuantumVerifier({
  strict: true,
  typeCheckLevel: 'quantum', // 'standard', 'strict', or 'quantum'
  securityCheckLevel: 'quantum',
  performanceCheckLevel: 'strict',
  testRequirements: {
    coverageThreshold: 85, // Custom threshold
    unitTestsRequired: true,
    integrationTestsRequired: true,
    e2eTestsRequired: false // Make E2E tests optional
  }
});

const result = await verifier.verifyCode(sourceCode, filePath);
```

### Integration with CI/CD

To integrate with CI/CD pipelines:

1. Add a verification step in your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Quantum Verification

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - name: Run Verification
        run: node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-directory.js src
```

2. Block merges if verification fails

### Visual Reports

For visual quality reports:

```javascript
const { QualityVisualizationGenerator } = require('./senior-engineer-framework/core/QualityVisualizationGenerator');

const generator = new QualityVisualizationGenerator();
const dashboard = await generator.generateQualityDashboard(verificationResult);

console.log(`Quality dashboard generated at: ${dashboard.dashboardPath}`);
```

## Example Verification Workflow

Here's a typical workflow using the Senior Engineer Framework:

1. **Start continuous verification** at the beginning of your work session
2. **Write code** as normal, fixing issues as they're identified in real-time
3. **Review periodic reports** to identify patterns and improvement areas
4. **Commit your changes** when all files pass verification
5. **CI pipeline verifies** the entire codebase again
6. **Generate quality visualizations** for team review

## Conclusion

The Senior Engineer Framework v9.0 provides comprehensive verification to ensure your code meets the highest quality standards. By following this guide and integrating the framework into your workflow, you can produce more reliable, maintainable, and high-quality code.
