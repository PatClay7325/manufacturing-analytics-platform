# Senior Engineer Framework v9.0 - Quantum Verification Edition

> Advanced code quality verification with continuous monitoring and tamper-proof evidence

## Overview

The Senior Engineer Framework v9.0 "Quantum Verification Edition" is a comprehensive system for ensuring code quality through continuous, automated verification. It provides real-time feedback, immutable evidence of quality, and advanced metrics to guide development.

## Features

- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time code quality monitoring
- **Quantum Type Safety**: Advanced type checking beyond TypeScript
- **Security Analysis**: Detect vulnerabilities and security issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure WCAG standards compliance
- **Immutable Evidence**: Blockchain-style verification proof
- **Git Integration**: Pre-commit verification hooks
- **Auto-fix Capabilities**: Automatic correction of common issues
- **Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive quality assessment

## Quick Start

### Verify a File

```bash
# Verify a single file
node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/verify-file.js src/components/MyComponent.tsx
```

### Start Continuous Verification

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/start-monitoring.js
```

### Customize Verification

```bash
# Watch specific paths with auto-fix enabled
node senior-engineer-framework/scripts/start-monitoring.js --paths=src/features/**/*.ts --auto-fix
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see:

- [Usage Guide](./docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive usage instructions
- [Framework Specification](./COMPREHENSIVE_SENIOR_ENGINEER_FRAMEWORK_V9.0.md) - Complete framework details

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+
- TypeScript 4.5+ (recommended)
- Git repository (for Git integration)

## Installation

The framework is already set up in your project structure. To update dependencies:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
npm install --save-dev typescript chokidar crypto
```

## Verification Standards

The framework verifies code against the following quality dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Type Safety | Strict typing and type correctness | 90% |
| Security | Freedom from security vulnerabilities | 95% |
| Testability | Ease of writing tests, expected coverage | 80% |
| Performance | Code efficiency and optimization | 80% |
| Accessibility | WCAG compliance and accessibility features | 80% |
| Overall Quality | Weighted combination of all dimensions | 85% |
