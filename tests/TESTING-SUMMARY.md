# Testing Infrastructure Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the testing infrastructure for the Manufacturing Analytics Platform. The infrastructure follows industry best practices for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Testing Dependencies

We installed the following dependencies:

- **Vitest**: For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing
- **MSW**: For API mocking

Installation script: `install-test-deps.cmd`

### 2. Test Configuration

- **Vitest Configuration**: Set up in `vitest.config.ts` with proper module resolution, test environment, and coverage reporting
- **Playwright Configuration**: Set up in `playwright.config.ts` with environment detection, device simulation, and special handling for WSL environments
- **Test Setup**: Created in `vitest.setup.ts` with Next.js component mocking and test utilities

### 3. Test Utilities

- **Rendering Utilities**: Custom render function that supports providers and test-specific configurations
- **Test Data Factories**: Functions for creating test data with sensible defaults
- **Mocks**: Mock implementations for Next.js components, API calls, and application services

### 4. Sample Tests

- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Basic tests for utility functions
  - Component tests for UI elements
  - Function tests for business logic

- **E2E Tests**:
  - Navigation tests
  - Equipment page tests
  - Form interaction tests

### 5. Special WSL Handling

We implemented special handling for WSL environments, where browser tests may not work correctly due to missing dependencies:

- Detection of WSL environment
- Skip/bypass browser tests in WSL
- Run in CI mode when in WSL
- Alternative test runner script (`run-tests.sh`)

### 6. Documentation

- **Main Testing Guide**: `README-TESTING.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the testing approach
- **Testing Summary**: This document
- **Script Documentation**: Comments in test runner scripts and configuration files

## Running Tests

- Unit and Integration Tests: `npm run test`
- End-to-End Tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- All Tests: `npm run test:all` or `./run-tests.sh --all`

## Verification

We've verified that:

- Unit tests run successfully
- Component tests run successfully
- Utility function tests run successfully
- E2E tests have proper configuration
- The testing infrastructure handles WSL environments gracefully

## Next Steps

- Implement additional tests as components are developed
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- Configure code coverage tracking and reporting
- Implement visual regression testing
