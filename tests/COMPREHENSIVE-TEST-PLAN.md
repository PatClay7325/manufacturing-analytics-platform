   ```
   Dashboard → Equipment List → Equipment Detail → Update Status → View Metrics
   ```

2. **Alert Management Flow**
   ```
   Alert Notification → View Alert → Acknowledge → Assign → Resolve
   ```

3. **Analytics Flow**
   ```
   Dashboard → Select Metrics → Configure Time Range → Export Data
   ```

4. **Chat Assistant Flow**
   ```
   Open Chat → Ask Question → Receive Response → Follow-up → Save Context
   ```

### D. API Testing

#### Endpoints to Test:
- `/api/equipment/*` - CRUD operations
- `/api/alerts/*` - Alert management
- `/api/metrics/*` - Data ingestion and queries
- `/api/chat/*` - AI interactions
- `/api/ws/*` - WebSocket connections

#### Test Scenarios:
- Valid requests with various payloads
- Invalid data handling
- Authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting
- Error responses
- Timeout handling

### E. Performance Testing

#### Metrics to Monitor:
- Page Load Time (PLT)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

#### Load Testing Scenarios:
- 100 concurrent users
- 1000 equipment records
- 10,000 alerts
- Real-time data streaming
- Large dataset exports

### F. Security Testing

#### OWASP Top 10 Coverage:
1. Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
2. Broken authentication
3. Sensitive data exposure
4. XML external entities (XXE)
5. Broken access control
6. Security misconfiguration
7. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging & monitoring

### G. Accessibility Testing

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators
- Alternative text for images
- Form labels and errors
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes

## Test Data Strategy

### Test Data Sets:
1. **Minimal**: Basic functionality testing
2. **Standard**: Typical production scenario
3. **Large**: Performance and scale testing
4. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions

### Data Generation:
- Factories for consistent test data
- Seeders for database population
- Mock data for external services
- Synthetic time-series data

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline:
1. **Pre-commit**: Linting and type checking
2. **Pull Request**: Unit and integration tests
3. **Main Branch**: Full E2E suite
4. **Nightly**: Performance and security scans
