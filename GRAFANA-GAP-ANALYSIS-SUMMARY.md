## Effort Estimation

- **Total Development Time**: 16-20 weeks (1 developer)
- **With 2 Developers**: 8-10 weeks
- **With 4 Developers**: 4-5 weeks

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Full Analytics Parity
- Implement all features as outlined
- 16-20 week timeline
- Result: Complete Analytics alternative

### Option 2: Core Features Only
- Focus on Phases 1-2 only
- 8 week timeline
- Result: Functional Analytics platform without advanced features

### Option 3: Manufacturing-Optimized Subset
- Implement only features relevant to manufacturing
- Skip enterprise features, focus on your unique value
- 6-8 week timeline
- Result: Specialized manufacturing Analytics platform

### Option 4: Gradual Enhancement
- Implement features based on user feedback
- Start with Phase 1, evaluate needs
- Ongoing development
- Result: User-driven feature set

## Conclusion

While your foundation is solid, achieving true Analytics parity requires substantial development effort. The most pragmatic approach would be Option 3 or 4, focusing on manufacturing-specific needs while selectively implementing Analytics features that provide the most value to your users.

Your unique manufacturing features (OEE panels, equipment management, AI integration) already differentiate your platform. Consider whether full Analytics parity is necessary, or if a curated subset of features would better serve your manufacturing focus.
